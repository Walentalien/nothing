Phase 1: Core Game Structure (Deadline: 4.04)
Objectives:

Build Kivy app with screen management.

Define base models: Patient, Doctor, Symptoms.

Add simple main menu and screen navigation.

Implement specialization selection (Cardiology, General, etc.).

Load patient data from JSON or SQLite.

Create simple patient screen with vitals: pulse, blood pressure, symptoms.

âœ… Phase 2: Diagnosis and Treatment Logic (Deadline: 30.04)
Features:

Let player choose diagnostic tests.

Add drug system with effects (e.g., beta-blockers lower pulse).

Simulate patient response to medication.

Add worsening condition on wrong diagnosis.

Add test results view: table-like format for ECG, blood, urine.

GUI for drug administration.

Initial patient animation system: skin color, face expression (can be static for now).

âœ… Phase 3: Medical Database and GUI Expansion (Deadline: 16.05)
Tasks:

Connect to local SQLite medical database.

Add more detailed patient data: ECG, RTG, etc.

Ensure that tests/diagnoses pull realistic data.

Add buttons and logic for minor medical procedures (e.g. IV drip, oxygen).

Expand patient state animation (e.g., animated heart monitor).

Summary screen after case: patient survived/died, mistakes, score.

âœ… Phase 4: Game Logic, Testing & Effects (Deadline: 30.05)
Improvements:

Add multiple patient case scenarios.

Balance difficulty (easy/medium/hard).

Sound effects (heart monitor, alerts).

Final animations (defibrillator shock, CPR).

Prepare elevator pitch screen: summary, video-ready.
