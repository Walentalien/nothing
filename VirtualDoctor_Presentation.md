def generate_patient_specific_ecg(patient):
    base_rhythm = normal_sinus_rhythm(patient.heart_rate)
    
    if patient.has_condition("atrial_fibrillation"):
        rhythm = apply_afib_pattern(base_rhythm)
    elif patient.has_condition("myocardial_infarction"):
        rhythm = apply_mi_changes(base_rhythm, patient.infarct_location)
    
    return render_ecg_image(rhythm)
```
